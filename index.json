PDF copies of the evaluation reports are available upon request.\n James answered every single question we asked with patience.\nJames was incredibly helpful and thoughtful and contributed well to help me through the labs by being patient and understanding. He presented problems in ways that allowed me to developed and work to find the answers on my own.\nJames especially worked really hard to encourage students to ask questions. He was patient and always tried to find explanations that worked for the particular student. If he didn't know an answer, he would actually try to find it himself. I always felt very comfortable coming to James for help on the labs or homework.\nJames did a great job giving real world examples to explain concepts. He found out that I liked aerospace applications and went an extra mile to provide examples that related to space which was awesome!\nJames is very patient and friendly, making his contributions in lab section effective and fun.\nJames devoted a lot of time to helping students and always helped me out when I needed him.\nThank you James! I had a great quarter with you, awesome TA :D\nJames is the best TA iâ€™ve ever seen\nJames was very helpful and also very patient with helping us code. Debugging is super tenuous but James helped a lot with easing my mind\nJames was very accessible and willing to help. Clearly knows his stuff.\nJames was the best TA I have ever had. He was helping everybody all the time. Every student knew they could go to him for help. He was always willing to help and would stay in the labs for hours on end at times. There was a specific time when he stayed until midnight helping students. He\u0026hellip;would sometimes stay over their assigned office hour times and interfere with their own personal responsibilities just to help us out.\nHe was available to help even at 10 at night\nJames knows his content for the class , and with one peek he can find the problems for my labs.\nMore TAs like James Rosenthal.\nMore James\nJames was able to teach us a extremely useful writing and presentation skills\nJames is really helpful and cares student's performance. Thank you, James!\nJames did a really good job of reinforcing what we learned in lectures in his quiz sections.\nJames is a great communicator that gets his points across well. He understands students\u0026rsquo; questions and answers them in-depth and to the bests of his ability. I wish he could have taught the whole course.\nThank you for being a fantastic TA\n","date":1585166299,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585166299,"objectID":"14d5e6ab1bc28b06b6a9f5a2605c2685","permalink":"https://jdrosent.github.io/teaching/reviews/","publishdate":"2020-03-25T12:58:19-07:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/reviews/","section":"teaching","summary":"Compilation of student responses from course evaluations.","tags":[],"title":"Student Reviews","type":"teaching"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585101661,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585101661,"objectID":"4b16c706535a68542faee558deccb7d9","permalink":"https://jdrosent.github.io/post/neurodisc/","publishdate":"2020-03-24T19:01:01-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/neurodisc/","section":"post","summary":"A wireless backscatter brain-computer interface for electrophysiology experiments","tags":["biomedical devices","bci","bmi","backscatter"],"title":"NeuroDisc","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"\r\r\rVisiting the Buddha of Swat.
