The rapid improvements in computing systems and artificial intelligence offer tremendous opportunities for finding meaning in large, complex data sets. However, the outputs of these systems\u0026ndash;and the trust that they garner\u0026ndash;are only as good as they data that goes in. My research seeks to produce high-quality data that can be used to formulate high-quality decisions.\nMy work has included measuring biologically harmful radiation from space to improve aviation safety while working at NASA as well as measuring neural ensemble activity in the brain to develop revolutionary treatments at the UW Center for Neurotechnology.\nThe focus of my dissertation is on novel wireless sensing systems that improve our ability to measure and interpret challenging phenomena, like neural activity. Common wireless solutions, like Bluetooth and WiFi require far too much power (did you realize that nearly half your phone is a battery?). By reducing the size, weight, and power needs of our wireless sensors, we can enable exploration of diverse, extreme environments, from the brain to the solar system.\nMuch of my work has been on embedded-electronics and instrumentation hardware for government, industry, and academic research. Examples include nanosatellite avionics, ultra-low power wireless brain-computer interfaces, and a radiation sensing system for high-altitude balloons.\nI strongly believe that publications alone are not enough to communicate with the public, especially for tax payer-funded research, therefore it is our responsibility as researchers to provide full-value to the public and earn their support through STEAM outreach, mentoring, and community service.\nFor an overview of my experience, see my CV. For more details on my work, check out my Publications and Projects on this site. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://jdrosent.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Hello, I am a Ph.D. student and National Science Graduate Research Fellow in the Department of Electrical \u0026amp; Computer Engineering at the University of Washington (UW).\n\u0026ldquo;Garbage in, garbage out\u0026rdquo; is a phrase that describes a common pitfall in computing.

PDF copies of the evaluation reports are available upon request.\n James answered every single question we asked with patience.\nJames was incredibly helpful and thoughtful and contributed well to help me through the labs by being patient and understanding. He presented problems in ways that allowed me to developed and work to find the answers on my own.\nJames especially worked really hard to encourage students to ask questions. He was patient and always tried to find explanations that worked for the particular student. If he didn't know an answer, he would actually try to find it himself. I always felt very comfortable coming to James for help on the labs or homework.\nJames did a great job giving real world examples to explain concepts. He found out that I liked aerospace applications and went an extra mile to provide examples that related to space which was awesome!\nJames is very patient and friendly, making his contributions in lab section effective and fun.\nJames devoted a lot of time to helping students and always helped me out when I needed him.\nThank you James! I had a great quarter with you, awesome TA :D\nJames is the best TA iâ€™ve ever seen\nJames was very helpful and also very patient with helping us code. Debugging is super tenuous but James helped a lot with easing my mind\nJames was very accessible and willing to help. Clearly knows his stuff.\nJames was the best TA I have ever had. He was helping everybody all the time. Every student knew they could go to him for help. He was always willing to help and would stay in the labs for hours on end at times. There was a specific time when he stayed until midnight helping students. He\u0026hellip;would sometimes stay over their assigned office hour times and interfere with their own personal responsibilities just to help us out.\nHe was available to help even at 10 at night\nJames knows his content for the class , and with one peek he can find the problems for my labs.\nMore TAs like James Rosenthal.\nMore James\nJames was able to teach us a extremely useful writing and presentation skills\nJames is really helpful and cares student's performance. Thank you, James!\nJames did a really good job of reinforcing what we learned in lectures in his quiz sections.\nJames is a great communicator that gets his points across well. He understands students\u0026rsquo; questions and answers them in-depth and to the bests of his ability. I wish he could have taught the whole course.\nThank you for being a fantastic TA\n","date":1585166299,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585166299,"objectID":"14d5e6ab1bc28b06b6a9f5a2605c2685","permalink":"https://jdrosent.github.io/teaching/reviews/","publishdate":"2020-03-25T12:58:19-07:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/reviews/","section":"teaching","summary":"Compilation of student responses from course evaluations.","tags":[],"title":"Student Reviews","type":"teaching"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585101661,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585101661,"objectID":"4b16c706535a68542faee558deccb7d9","permalink":"https://jdrosent.github.io/post/neurodisc/","publishdate":"2020-03-24T19:01:01-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/neurodisc/","section":"post","summary":"A wireless backscatter brain-computer interface for electrophysiology experiments","tags":["biomedical devices","bci","bmi","backscatter"],"title":"NeuroDisc","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r ","date":1585101661,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585101661,"objectID":"ec7e517ff3f16250c0e13610ed47e599","permalink":"https://jdrosent.github.io/travel/test/","publishdate":"2020-03-24T19:01:01-07:00","relpermalink":"/travel/test/","section":"travel","summary":"Visited Pakistan with a friend from undergrad and students from UVA's business school.
